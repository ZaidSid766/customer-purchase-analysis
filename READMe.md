# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis Dashboard

## 📘 Project Overview
This project analyzes **customer shopping behavior** using real transactional data consisting of **3,900 purchases** across multiple product categories.  
The main objective is to identify **customer trends, spending habits, product preferences, and subscription patterns** to support **data-driven business decisions**.

## 🧾 Dataset Summary

| **Details** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Rows** | 3,900 |
| **Columns** | 18 |
| **Key Features** | Age, Gender, Location, Subscription Status, Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount, Season, Size, Color, Review Rating, Shipping Type, Discount Applied, Previous Purchases, Frequency of Purchases |
| **Missing Values** | 37 missing values in `Review Rating` column |

## 🐍 Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)

### 🔹 1. Data Loading
Imported dataset using **Pandas**:
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('customer_behavior.csv')
```

### 🔹 2. Initial Exploration
Checked data structure and summary:
```python
df.info()
df.describe()
```

### 🔹 3. Handling Missing Values
Filled missing `Review Rating` values with **median of each product category**:
```python
df['review_rating'] = df.groupby('category')['review_rating'].transform(lambda x: x.fillna(x.median()))
```

### 🔹 4. Column Standardization
Renamed columns to **snake_case** for readability:
```python
df.columns = df.columns.str.lower().str.replace(' ', '_')
```

### 🔹 5. Feature Engineering
- Created `age_group` using quantile binning:
  ```python
  labels = ['Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Middle-aged', 'Senior']
  df['age_group'] = pd.qcut(df['age'], q=4, labels=labels)
  ```
- Derived `purchase_frequency_days` for behavioral analysis.
- Checked redundancy between `discount_applied` and `promo_code_used` → dropped the redundant column.

### 🔹 6. Database Integration
Connected the cleaned dataset to **MySQL Workbench** for structured data analysis:
```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://root:password@localhost/customer_behaviour')
df.to_sql('customer', engine, if_exists='replace', index=False)
```

## 🧠 Step 2: SQL-Based Business Analysis (MySQL Workbench)

SQL queries were executed using **MySQL Workbench** to analyze customer transactions and purchasing behavior.  

### 🔹 Database Setup Commands
```sql
CREATE DATABASE customer_behaviour;
USE customer_behaviour;
```

### 🔹 Business Analysis Queries
| **#** | **Query Objective** | **Purpose** |
|-------|----------------------|--------------|
| 1 | Revenue by Gender | Compare revenue between male and female customers |
| 2 | High-Spending Discount Users | Identify users who use discounts but spend above average |
| 3 | Top 5 Products by Rating | Find best-rated products |
| 4 | Shipping Type Comparison | Compare average purchase across shipping modes |
| 5 | Subscribers vs Non-Subscribers | Evaluate subscription impact on spending |
| 6 | Discount-Dependent Products | Identify products relying heavily on discounts |
| 7 | Customer Segmentation | Classify users as New, Returning, or Loyal |
| 8 | Top 3 Products per Category | Find most popular products per category |
| 9 | Repeat Buyers & Subscriptions | Check link between frequent purchases and subscriptions |
| 10 | Revenue by Age Group | Analyze spending by age group |

### 🔹 Example Query
```sql
SELECT gender, SUM(purchase_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM customer
GROUP BY gender;
```

This query compares total revenue generated by male vs female customers.

|--------------------|-------------|
| Donut Chart | Customers by Subscription Status (Yes 27%, No 73%) |
| Bar Chart | Revenue by Product Category |
| Bar Chart | Sales by Category |
| Bar Chart | Revenue by Age Group |
| Bar Chart | Sales by Age Group |
| Filters | Gender, Subscription Status, Category, Shipping Type |
